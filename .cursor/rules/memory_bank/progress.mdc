## In Progress

### Company Card Updates
- [~] ADNOC card - needs multi-step flow implementation
- [~] Other company cards - need multi-step flow implementation

## To Do (Backlog)

### High Priority
- [x] Apply multi-step flow to Accenture card
- [>] Apply multi-step flow to ADNOC card
- [>] Apply multi-step flow to remaining company cards:
  - [>] Al Rashed
  - [>] Al Rugaib
  - [>] Aramco
  - [>] BCI
  - [>] GDC
  - [>] Hader
  - [>] Kleen
  - [>] Marsh
  - [>] Milano
  - [>] Plant
  - [>] SLIC
  - [>] Tamimi
  - [>] Zamil

### Medium Priority
- [>] Test all company cards end-to-end
- [>] Verify SheetDB integration for all cards
- [>] Mobile responsiveness testing
- [>] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [>] Performance optimization

### Low Priority
- [>] Add input validation for name field
- [>] Add character limits for name input
- [>] Error handling for failed API calls
- [>] Loading states for canvas rendering
- [>] Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels)

## Known Issues

### Current Bugs
- None identified (Almanaa card is fully functional)

### Limitations
- Other company cards still show "expired link" messages
- No input validation on name field
- No error handling for SheetDB API failures
- No loading indicators during font/image loading

## Testing Status

### Almanaa Card
- [x] Language selection works
- [x] Message selection works
- [x] Name entry works
- [x] Preview updates correctly
- [x] Download generates PNG
- [x] SheetDB logging works
- [~] Mobile testing pending
- [~] Cross-browser testing pending

### Other Cards
- [ ] Testing pending (need multi-step flow implementation first)

## Next Immediate Actions
1. Test Almanaa card on mobile devices
2. Apply multi-step flow pattern to Accenture card
3. Verify all assets (images, fonts) exist for each company
4. Test SheetDB integration across all cards

## Notes
- The multi-step flow pattern is established and can be replicated
- Each company card follows the same structure
- Main work remaining is applying the pattern to existing cards
- All company cards currently use the "expired link" pattern (needs update)
