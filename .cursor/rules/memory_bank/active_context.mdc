# Active Context: Current Operations

## Current Focus
Project scope reduced to Almanaa only. All other company cards (Accenture, ADNOC, Al Rashed, etc.) have been removed. Almanaa card is fully functional and ready for use.

## Recent Changes (Latest Session)
1. ✅ Removed all company cards except Almanaa (15 HTML files deleted)
2. ✅ Removed associated JS and CSS for removed companies (15 each)
3. ✅ Updated Memory Bank to reflect Almanaa-only scope

## Current State
- **Almanaa Card:** Only company card; fully functional with multi-step flow
- **Other Companies:** All removed (no other company HTML/JS/CSS remain)
- **Architecture:** Multi-step flow pattern established and documented
- **UI/UX:** Navy blue theme with animated backgrounds

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Test Almanaa card flow end-to-end
2. Verify SheetDB integration is working correctly
3. Test responsive design on mobile devices

## Active Decisions
- **Language Switching:** Once language is selected, all UI switches to that language (not bilingual)
- **Step Navigation:** Back/Next buttons on all steps except language selection
- **Preview Display:** Canvas preview visible on all steps, updates in real-time
- **Message Options:** Two pre-defined messages per language (not user-customizable)

## Pending Questions
- Should we add any validation for name input (character limits, special characters)?
- Do we need to support additional languages beyond Arabic and English?

## Critical Considerations
- **Font Loading:** Ensure fonts are loaded before canvas rendering
- **Image Paths:** Verify all company card images exist in assets/images/
- **Canvas Dimensions:** Standard size is 1080x1920 (portrait orientation)
- **Text Positioning:** Name at Y position (imageHeight - 650), Message at (imageHeight - 800)

## Known Issues
- None currently identified (Almanaa card is fully functional)

## Testing Status
- Almanaa card: Ready for user testing (only card in project)
