# Active Context: Current Operations

## Current Focus
The Almanaa company card has been fully implemented with the complete multi-step flow. The system is operational and ready for testing. Next steps involve applying the same pattern to other company cards.

## Recent Changes (Latest Session)
1. ✅ Implemented complete multi-step flow for Almanaa card
2. ✅ Added language selection with full UI switching (Arabic/English)
3. ✅ Implemented message selection (2 options per language)
4. ✅ Added name entry with real-time preview updates
5. ✅ Created step indicators with visual progress tracking
6. ✅ Added navigation buttons (Back/Next) for all steps
7. ✅ Implemented language-specific content switching
8. ✅ Updated project description documentation
9. ✅ Created comprehensive Memory Bank documentation
10. ✅ Applied multi-step flow to Accenture card (HTML, JS, CSS)

## Current State
- **Almanaa Card:** Fully functional with all features implemented
- **Accenture Card:** Fully functional with all features implemented
- **Other Company Cards:** Still showing expired link messages (need to be updated)
- **Architecture:** Multi-step flow pattern established and documented
- **UI/UX:** Navy blue theme with animated backgrounds implemented

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Test Accenture card flow end-to-end
2. Apply multi-step pattern to remaining company cards (ADNOC, Al Rashed, etc.)
3. Ensure all company cards use the same user flow
4. Verify SheetDB integration is working correctly
5. Test responsive design on mobile devices

## Active Decisions
- **Language Switching:** Once language is selected, all UI switches to that language (not bilingual)
- **Step Navigation:** Back/Next buttons on all steps except language selection
- **Preview Display:** Canvas preview visible on all steps, updates in real-time
- **Message Options:** Two pre-defined messages per language (not user-customizable)

## Pending Questions
- Should all company cards use the same two messages, or company-specific messages?
- Are there any additional companies that need cards created?
- Should we add any validation for name input (character limits, special characters)?
- Do we need to support additional languages beyond Arabic and English?

## Critical Considerations
- **Font Loading:** Ensure fonts are loaded before canvas rendering
- **Image Paths:** Verify all company card images exist in assets/images/
- **Canvas Dimensions:** Standard size is 1080x1920 (portrait orientation)
- **Text Positioning:** Name at Y position (imageHeight - 650), Message at (imageHeight - 800)

## Known Issues
- None currently identified (Almanaa card is fully functional)

## Testing Status
- Almanaa card: Ready for user testing
- Other cards: Pending implementation of multi-step flow
